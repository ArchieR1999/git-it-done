# git-it-done

## Functionality : 

This app allows the user to filter repositories on GitHub which have open issues or pull requests. When the user types a valid GitHub username into the search field, that account's repositories with open issues is displayed. 

Alternatively, there are 3 buttons underneath the searchbar, and these are 'javascript, html, and css'. These buttons will take the user to open issues that use those 3 langauges respecitvely. 

When the user clicks on a user's repo with open issues, he/she is taken to another screen with more details. Clicking on a box will take the user to that person's GitHub open issues or pull request page. From there, the user can work on these issues, exactly how an open source developer would.
